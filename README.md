# Robot War Simulator (Terminal-Based C++ Project)

This project is a terminal-based battle simulator built fully in C++, developed as part of a group assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming & Data Structures course.

The simulator generates different robot types on a grid-based battlefield and simulates their interactions, movement, shooting, respawning, upgrading, and elimination.

## Features :
### Multiple Robot Types

KiloBot
MegaBot
GigaBot
UltimateRobot
RoboTank
MadBot
BlueThunder

### Each with unique rules for:

Movement
Shooting behavior
Stepping (destroying by contact)
Seeing nearby robots
Upgrading to stronger types

### Battlefield Simulation:

Custom grid size
Robots spawn at random positions

### Each turn:
Robots see, move, shoot, step, respawn
All actions logged in a .txt file

### Queue-Based Respawn System:

Robots with remaining lives enter a respawn queue and rejoin later.

### Object-Oriented Implementation:

Uses inheritance, virtual classes, and polymorphism for robot behaviors.

#### To run, compile and run the .cpp file
